Reinforced Learning is learning what to do -how to map situations to actions- so as maximize a numerical reard signal. 

We formalize the problem of reinforcement learning using ideas from dynamical systems theory, specially, as the optimal control of incompletely-known Markov decission processes. 

One of the challenges that arise in reinforcement learning, and not in other kinds of learning, is the trade-off betweeen exploration and exploitation. The agent has.
